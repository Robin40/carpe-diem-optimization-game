# Carpe Diem Optimization Game

This is the game from https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2015/03/17/carpe-diem-the-optimization-game-level-1/, and the rules are explained there.

I am NOT the creator of Don't Worry About the Vase nor the game. I am a reader of the blog and implemented the game of that article in a weekend as a learning exercise.

You can play at https://carpe-diem-optimization-game.surge.sh/ (mobile and desktop both supported).

Reload the page to restart the game.

Energy loss at the start of the day is calculated using the first card.
